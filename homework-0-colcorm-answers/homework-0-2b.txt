Problem 2 b)
    The reason why it is better to use the median instead of the
    mean of an attribute for missing values is that if we used the
    means of the data there would be the potential for outliers 
    in our data set to dominate the mean either inflating it, or 
    deflating it out of the normal range of most values in the set.
    By using the median we solve this problem and there is a more 
    probable chance that we get a value that reflects the typical
    value for an attribute in that category.
